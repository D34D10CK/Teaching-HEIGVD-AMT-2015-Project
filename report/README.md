### Tasks realized by the different team members



## Introduction

This is a group project for the AMT course of HEIG-VD. The goal is to developp a website using JavaEE on a glassfish server. The website have a list of users who can submit applications. In the project, we will design and build a generic gamification platform. In other words, we will create a service that will be used by other developers.

###Part 1
In the first part of the project, we will apply techniques presented in the course to build the foundation of the gamification platform. We will implement a simple domain model to deal with user accounts, roles, applications and API keys. We will also implement a web UI to manage these elements. An automated test procedure will also be written.

## User Guide

### How to execute and access the application
### How to use the application
### How to update, build and deploy the application

Building the application should be pretty straightforward.      
Deploying the application can be done on the admin console of glassfish (localhost:4848).
Before beig able to run the application, the user must create a local mysql database named "AMTdatabase" and a user
"AMTUser" with password "amtpassword".
